ScANN
=====

The goal of ScANN is to provide a toolbox for reserachers and students to learn about and play with Artificial Neural Networks. This is achieved by adopting a nearly pure functional programming style; in this style neurons, cost functions, and training are reduced to interchangeable functions which can be composed by the network.
